**Welcome to the Capture-Recapture Simulation!**

1. Start by saving the utilities and driver script of this project into the same folder; the driver script will be pulling from the utilities script to run multiple functions in the simulation.
2. This simulation can be started using a bash terminal, and the driver script (written in R) should be sourced in the commandline along with the following arguments: total fish population you would like to study, the number of fish you would like to be tagged, and the number of fish you wish to recapture during the study.
3. The output will consist of a histogram with the estimated fish populations and frequency of occurence after sampling 1000 times.
